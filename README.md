# SL Capstone - Predicting Client Loan Repayments

In this repository you will find my supervised machine learning capstone project. In it, I used raw loan data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview) to develop a machine learning model that can effectively predict which customers will have trouble paying back their loans on time.

The whole project is accessible under 'Capstone II - Supervised Learning.ipynb', while the presentation that summarizes my findings is under 'Supervised Learning Capstone - Loan Risk Assessment.pdf'. Thanks for visiting.
